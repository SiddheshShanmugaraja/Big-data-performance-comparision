# Big-data-performance-comparision
The Big data analysis has become ubiquitous requirement for various industries to full fill those requirement  and large number of use cases Machine Learning technique can be used. The term “Big data” describes  scenario where the data is in large volume, So it takes more time for processing and model fitting for any kind  of machine learning algorithm. The ultimate aim is to find the hidden trend in the big data using clustering  technique in machine learning. This Big data is processed in different frameworks (i.e) Pyspark, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn for making  efficiency and time comparison measures, because each of these frameworks follow different architectures to  store and process the data. K-Means, an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm has been implemented in  all these different frameworks and their efficiency in finding the nature of the bitcoin heist are evaluated.
